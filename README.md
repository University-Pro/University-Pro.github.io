## üëã About Me

I am a Maste candidate at [School of Internet](https://si.ahu.edu.cn/) in [Anhui University](https://www.ahu.edu.cn/),specializing in Deeplearning in Computer Vision.  
My research interests lie in **Computer Vision**, **Medical Image Segmentation(MIS)**, and their applications in autonomous systems.

### Personal Future Plan
I am actively pursuing a PhD position in Japan, with a planned start in Fall 2026 or Spring 2027.  
To facilitate a smooth transition, I am open to beginning as a research student (Á†î‰øÆÁîü) for several months to adapt to life in a new cultural and academic environment.  
Japan is my preferred destination for doctoral studies compare with other countries in Asia.  
After graduate from Phd, I decide to continue to find a job in Japan.

## üìú Publications & Preprints

### [DLKUNet: A Lightweight and Efficient Network With Depthwise Large Kernel for Medical Image Segmentation] | Python, PyTorch [Published]
**[üîó Paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ima.70035) | [üìÇ Code](https://github.com/University-Pro/DLKUNet)**

*   **Description:**  Developed a novel and efficient network for medical image segmentation. The model aims to achieve a better trade-off between performance and computation cost. (For more detail, please check the Github Repository or Paper's website.)
*   **Outcome:** Three different kinds of model we proposed demostrated SOTA while significantly reducing the number of parameters and computational complexity compared to previous methods. (For more detail, please check the Github Repository or Paper's website.)

### [KANSeg: An efficient medical image segmentation model based on Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for multi-organ segmentation] | Python, Pytorch [Published]
**[üîó Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051200425004944) | [üìÇ Code](https://github.com/University-Pro/KANSeg)**

*   **Descripition:** Explored the application of the novel Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for medical image segmentation. We develop a KAN-Activated Convolution module (KAN-ACM) to construct both the encoder and decoder, thereby enhancing the learning and interpretation of intricate patterns within multi-organ images. (For more detail, please check the Github Repository or Paper's website.)
*   **Outcome:**  The proposed KANSeg can achieve Dice Score of 79.95%, 90.99% on the Synapse multi-organ dataset (Synapse) and the Automated cardiac diagnosis challenge (ACDC) datasets. The outcomes demonstrate that our method yields more accurate segmentation results compared with state-of-the-art methods. (For more detail, please check the Github Repository or Paper's website.)

### Uncertainty-aware 3D Medical Image Segmentation with SAM | Python, Pytorch [Manuscript in Preparation]
**[üìÇ Code](https://github.com/University-Pro/DLKUNet)**

*   **Descripition:** We introduce a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation framework with Decoupled Uncertainty Prompt Generator (DUPG), which intelligently generates effective prompts while maintaining superior segmentation performance in data-scarce scenarios. 
*   **Outcome:** Under the challenging constraint of only 10% labeled data, our method achieves remarkable Dice coefficients of 68.78% on AMOS and 90.02% on LA, demonstrating the performance of our semi-supervised learning framework in scenarios with limited supervision.

### Learning Dynamic Recursive Depths for Image Segmentation Network... | Python, Pytorch [Comming soon]
