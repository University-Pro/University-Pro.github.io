## 👋 About Me

Hello! I am a Master's student at [School of Internet](https://si.ahu.edu.cn/) in [Anhui University](https://www.ahu.edu.cn/), specializing in Deeplearning in Computer Vision. 
My research interests lie in **Computer Vision Processing**, **Medical Image Segmentation(MIS)**, and their applications in autonomous systems.

I am actively pursuing a PhD position in Japan, with a planned start in Fall 2026 or Spring 2027.
To facilitate a smooth transition, I am open to beginning as a research student (研修生) for several months to adapt to life in a new cultural and academic environment.
Japan is my preferred destination for doctoral studies compare with other countries in Asia, inspired by its leading advancements and technological innovation. 

I am proficient in **Python**, and **PyTorch**, and have hands-on experience with Deep Learning in Image Segmenation Framework.
I am skilled in surveying upstream research, reproducing state-of-the-art computer vision models in medical image segmentation, and extracting key components for implementation.
I have strong Linux proficiency and am adept at troubleshooting research-related issues via command-line environments.
I also possess foundational knowledge of Docker and have experience with virtualization platforms (such as Proxmox) for managing GPU resources across workstations and servers.
Additionally, I built and maintained an LLM server within my university’s network, serving over 900 users with access to various open-source models (e.g., Qwen and DeepSeek).
I am also experienced in maintaining and optimizing hardware components (CPU, GPU, memory, networking, PCI-E, etc.) for high-performance deep learning workloads.
For example, I successfully modified my RTX 2080 Ti by replacing its 1GB VRAM chips with 2GB ones, effectively doubling the VRAM to 22GB.

I’ve included a radar chart below to summarize my technical capabilities:
